* **Workflow Management**: Submit, monitor, and manage your ProActive workflows.
* **Resource Management**: Leverage the Resource Manager for efficient computing resource allocation.

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Python version 3.6 or later is required.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can easily install the ProActive Python Client using pip::

    pip install proactive

For access to the latest features and improvements, install the pre-release version::

    pip install --pre proactive

Building from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build and install the package from source::

    # Build the package
    make clean_build
    # or use gradlew
    gradlew clean build

    # Install the built package
    pip install dist/proactive-XXX.zip  # Replace XXX with the actual version

Running Tests
-------------

With Gradle
~~~~~~~~~~~

Specify your ProActive credentials and run the tests::

    ./gradlew clean build -Pproactive_url=YOUR_URL -Pusername=YOUR_USERNAME -Ppassword=YOUR_PASSWORD

With Make
~~~~~~~~~

First, create a ``.env`` file with your ProActive credentials::

    PROACTIVE_URL=YOUR_URL
    PROACTIVE_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME
    PROACTIVE_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD

Then execute::

    make test

Quickstart Example
------------------

This simple example demonstrates connecting to a ProActive server, creating a job, adding a Python task, and submitting the job::

    import os
    import getpass
    from proactive import ProActiveGateway

    proactive_url = "https://try.activeeon.com:8443"

    print(f"Connecting to {proactive_url}...")
    gateway = ProActiveGateway(proactive_url)

    # Securely input your credentials
    gateway.connect(username=input("Username: "), password=getpass.getpass("Password: "))
    assert gateway.isConnected(), "Failed to connect to the ProActive server!"

    # Job and task creation
    print("Creating and configuring a ProActive job and task...")
    proactive_job = gateway.createJob()
    proactive_job.setJobName("SimpleJob")

    proactive_task = gateway.createPythonTask("SimplePythonTask")
    proactive_task.setTaskImplementation('print("Hello from ProActive!")')
    proactive_job.addTask(proactive_task)

    # Job submission
    job_id = gateway.submitJob(proactive_job)
    print(f"Job submitted with ID: {job_id}")

    # Retrieve job output
    print("Job output:")
    print(gateway.getJobOutput(job_id))

    # Cleanup
    gateway.disconnect()
    gateway.terminate()
    print("Disconnected and finished.")
